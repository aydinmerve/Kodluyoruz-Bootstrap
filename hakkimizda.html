                <p>Yamaha's history began when its founder, Torakusu Yamaha, repaired a broken reed organ in 1887. Shortly thereafter, he successfully completed the first reed organ to be built in Japan.
              
                  Since then, Yamaha has continued to produce high-quality products by blending traditional craftsmanship with advanced digital technology. The quality of sound produced by a Yamaha musical instrument reflects the long years of accumulated technical expertise and the skilled craftsmanship of the Company.
                  
                  With our unique expertise and sensibilities, gained from our devotion to sound and music, the Group is committed to creating excitement and cultural inspiration together with people around the world.</p>
